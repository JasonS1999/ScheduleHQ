# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule

# THEME COLOR GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================
# To maintain consistent dark/light mode support, avoid these color patterns:
#
# PROHIBITED PATTERNS (use AppColors from lib/services/app_colors.dart instead):
#   - Colors.white            → use appColors.textOnSuccess or colorScheme.surface
#   - Colors.black            → use appColors.textPrimary or colorScheme.onSurface
#   - Colors.grey[###]        → use appColors.textSecondary or textTertiary
#   - Colors.*.shade50/100    → use appColors.*Background (e.g., successBackground)
#   - Color.fromRGBO(0,0,0,*) → use appColors.overlayDim or overlayLight
#   - Color(0xFF...)          → define semantic colors in AppColors extension
#
# Run the color pattern checker script to detect violations:
#   dart run tool/check_color_patterns.dart
#
# See test/theme_contrast_test.dart for theme accessibility tests.
